1. Among the seven different plots, which plot had the most number of species recorded? 

Agriculture = 88
Forested = 36
Garden = 58
Industrial = 112
Mowed Grass = 39
Praire = 88
Unmowed Grass = 137

    - What was the difference in the number of species found in similar environments
    We made a bar graph plotting the species found in Unmowed grass and mowed grass as we wanted to see difference in the varaieties of species found. 


2. Who identified the most number of species? Were they also the ones who collected the species? 

From the data calculated, we see that the number of times a person has collected and identified species are not the same. For instance, J.Hughes has collected 136 species however, he has identified 203. Therefore he has identified 67 more than he has collected. Whereas M.Gorsengner has collected 137 species by only identified 55. 

3. How many different species we found in each decade? 
1950s = 5
1960s = 10
1970s = 15
1980s = 12
1990s = 6
2000s = 4
2010s = 3
2020s = 14

4. How many species were found in the different states around the US?
Montana = 1
Minnesota = 6
Michigan = 1
Iowa = 331
Illinois = 296
Colorado = 2

5. What was the result of the t-test conducted? 
we conducted a t-test on the average species found in every plot. The result of the t-test were as follows:

data:  averageData$average_plot
t = 5.6029, df = 6, p-value = 0.001377
alternative hypothesis: true mean is not equal to 0
95 percent confidence interval:
 22.45072 57.26357
sample estimates:
mean of x 
 39.85714
 
From the results above we see that the p=value is 0.001377 which indicates that there is string evidence against the null hypothesis.
